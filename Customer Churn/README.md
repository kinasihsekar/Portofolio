Credit risk is an undeniable thing for a company providing financing services. One of the credit risks that is often experienced is the failure of customers to pay credit (default risk). The business problem faced is the high percentage of credit defaults of 8% or the equivalent of 20 thousand people, which can have a negative impact on the company's finances and the company's reputation in the eyes of customers. One company, namely Home Credit, is trying to improve the performance of its analysis results in credit risk. Home Credit uses a variety of alternative data--including telecommunications and transactional information-- to predict the repayment capabilities of their clients.

This project aims to predict aspects that influence customers' inability to pay credit using machine learning models. By knowing these factors, Home Credit can predict whether the client will fail to pay the credit or not.
